## The Challenge

Create a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

### Requirements

- Simple to use interface.
- The ability search the OMDB API and return a list of movies that show at least the title, release year and a button to nominate them.
- Search results should only be of movies.
- Updates to the search terms should update the result list.
- If a movie has been nominated already, it's button should be disabled within in search results.
- Nominated movies should move to their own "Nomination List".
- Movies in the nomination list should be able to be removed.
- Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.

### Extras

- Improve the design of the example.
- Save nomination lists if the user leaves the page.
